# 🏊 42 C Piscine Solutions

This repository contains my solutions for the **42 School C Piscine** exercises.

The 42 Piscine is an intensive programming bootcamp designed to build strong fundamentals in **C programming**, **problem-solving**, and **low-level programming concepts**.

This repo includes exercises from multiple modules, covering topics such as memory, pointers, strings, recursion, algorithms, and basic Unix tools.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

The main purpose of this repository is to:
- Practice and strengthen my C programming skills
- Improve problem-solving speed and coding discipline
- Build a structured archive of my Piscine progress
- Demonstrate consistency and coding fundamentals on GitHub

---

## 🧠 Topics Covered

During the Piscine, I worked on problems involving:

- Basic C syntax and logic
- Functions and modular programming
- Loops and conditional structures
- Pointers and memory manipulation
- String operations
- Arrays and multi-dimensional arrays
- Recursion
- Basic sorting and searching algorithms
- File handling (in later modules)
- Command-line tools and shell basics

## ⚠️ Notes

- These solutions were written during my learning process.
- Some exercises may have alternative implementations.
- Code is kept as close as possible to the Piscine rules and constraints.

---

## 🚀 Skills Developed

By completing the Piscine exercises, I improved my skills in:

- Writing clean and efficient C code
- Debugging and error handling
- Working under time pressure
- Understanding memory and pointer logic
- Building algorithmic thinking
